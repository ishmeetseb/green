## Button ranks

Buttons exist in three different ranks, Primary, Secondary and Tertiary

## Button sizes

Buttons can be small, medium or large. The default size is medium.

## Button with icon

Buttons can have an icon on the left or right side of the text. These are called leading or trailing icons, and are added by placing a `gds-icon` component in either the `lead` or `trail` slot.

  <Story of={ButtonStories.WithIcon} />
</Canvas>

## Button with icon only

If a single `gds-icon` is the only child of a button, it will render as a circular icon button.

  <Story of={ButtonStories.IconButton} />
</Canvas>

## Disabled

The buttons support a disabled state, but in general, it should not be used. It can be hard for the user to understand why the button is disabled, so it is often better to keep the button clickable and then show an error message
instead.
